Analysts attribute the selloff to investor concerns over rising interest rates and regulatory uncertainty.\n\nAmong the hardest hit, nexon technologies saw its stock plummet by 7.8% after reporting lower-than-expected quarterly earnings. In contrast, Omega Energy posted a modest 2.1% gain, driven by rising oil prices.\n\nMeanwhile, commodity markets reflected a mixed sentiment. Gold futures rose by 1.5%, reaching $2,080 per ounce, as investors sought safe-haven assets. Crude oil prices continued their rally, climbing to $87.60 per barrel, supported by supply constraints and strong demand.\n\nFinancial experts are closely watching the Federal Reserve's next move, as speculation grows over potential rate hikes.

Analysts attribute the selloff to investor concerns over rising interest rates and regulatory uncertainty.\n\nAmong the hardest hit, nexon technologies saw its stock plummet by 7.8% after reporting lower-than-expected quarterly earnings. In contrast, Omega Energy posted a modest 2.1% gain, driven by rising oil prices.\n\nMeanwhile, commodity markets reflected a mixed sentiment.

Analysts attribute the selloff to investor concerns over rising interest rates and regulatory uncertainty.\n\nAmong the hardest hit, nexon technologies saw its stock plummet by 7.8% after reporting lower-than-expected quarterly earnings. In contrast, Omega Energy posted a modest 2.1% gain, driven by rising oil prices.\n\nMeanwhile, commodity markets reflected a mixed sentiment. Gold futures rose by 1.5%, reaching $2,080 per ounce, as investors sought safe-haven assets. Crude oil prices continued their rally, climbing to $87.60 per barrel, supported by supply constraints and strong demand.\n\nFinancial experts are closely watching the Federal Reserve's next move, as speculation grows over potential rate hikes.

Analysts attribute the selloff to investor concerns over rising interest rates and regulatory uncertainty.\n\nAmong the hardest hit, nexon technologies saw its stock plummet by 7.8% after reporting lower-than-expected quarterly earnings. In contrast, Omega Energy posted a modest 2.1% gain, driven by rising oil prices.\n\nMeanwhile, commodity markets reflected a mixed sentiment. Gold futures rose by 1.5%, reaching $2,080 per ounce, as investors sought safe-haven assets. Crude oil prices continued their rally, climbing to $87.60 per barrel, supported by supply constraints and strong demand.\n\nFinancial experts are closely watching the Federal Reserve's next move, as speculation grows over potential rate hikes.

In contrast, Omega Energy posted a modest 2.1% gain, driven by rising oil prices.\n\nMeanwhile, commodity markets reflected a mixed sentiment.

Crude oil prices continued their rally, climbing to $87.60 per barrel, supported by supply constraints and strong demand.\n\nFinancial experts are closely watching the Federal Reserve's next move, as speculation grows over potential rate hikes.

Analysts attribute the selloff to investor concerns over rising interest rates and regulatory uncertainty.\n\nAmong the hardest hit, nexon technologies saw its stock plummet by 7.8% after reporting lower-than-expected quarterly earnings. In contrast, Omega Energy posted a modest 2.1% gain, driven by rising oil prices.\n\nMeanwhile, commodity markets reflected a mixed sentiment. Gold futures rose by 1.5%, reaching $2,080 per ounce, as investors sought safe-haven assets. Crude oil prices continued their rally, climbing to $87.60 per barrel, supported by supply constraints and strong demand.\n\nFinancial experts are closely watching the Federal Reserve's next move, as speculation grows over potential rate hikes. The upcoming policy announcement is expected to influence investor confidence and overall market stability.\n```\n\n<Output>\nentity<|#|>Global Tech Index<|#|>category<|#|>The Global Tech Index tracks

In contrast, Omega Energy posted a modest 2.1% gain, driven by rising oil prices.\n\nMeanwhile, commodity markets reflected a mixed sentiment.

Crude oil prices continued their rally, climbing to $87.60 per barrel, supported by supply constraints and strong demand.\n\nFinancial experts are closely watching the Federal Reserve's next move, as speculation grows over potential rate hikes.

In contrast, Omega Energy posted a modest 2.1% gain, driven by rising oil prices.\n\nMeanwhile, commodity markets reflected a mixed sentiment. Gold futures rose by 1.5%, reaching $2,080 per ounce, as investors sought safe-haven assets. Crude oil prices continued their rally, climbing to $87.60 per barrel, supported by supply constraints and strong demand.\n\nFinancial experts are closely watching the Federal Reserve's next move, as speculation grows over potential rate hikes.

Analysts attribute the selloff to investor concerns over rising interest rates and regulatory uncertainty.\n\nAmong the hardest hit, nexon technologies saw its stock plummet by 7.8% after reporting lower-than-expected quarterly earnings. In contrast, Omega Energy posted a modest 2.1% gain, driven by rising oil prices.\n\nMeanwhile, commodity markets reflected a mixed sentiment. Gold futures rose by 1.5%, reaching $2,080 per ounce, as investors sought safe-haven assets. Crude oil prices continued their rally, climbing to $87.60 per barrel, supported by supply constraints and strong demand.\n\nFinancial experts are closely watching the Federal Reserve's next move, as speculation grows over potential rate hikes.

Analysts attribute the selloff to investor concerns over rising interest rates and regulatory uncertainty.\n\nAmong the hardest hit, nexon technologies saw its stock plummet by 7.8% after reporting lower-than-expected quarterly earnings. In contrast, Omega Energy posted a modest 2.1% gain, driven by rising oil prices.\n\nMeanwhile, commodity markets reflected a mixed sentiment.

It is incorporated at multiple stages of cooking: during the initial preparation of the fish or chicken broth, in marinades for proteins such as chicken, and again when reheating the soup for serving. Ginger may be used in various forms—including sliced (typically around 10g when specified), minced, or as part of a ginger-garlic paste—depending on the specific step in the recipe. Its primary culinary contributions are to impart a warm, pungent aroma and to enhance the overall depth of flavor in both the broth and marinated ingredients.

    "return": "Scallion (大葱), a type of green onion, is widely used in culinary applications for its aromatic and flavorful properties. It serves multiple roles across various stages of cooking: as a fresh garnish—particularly in dipping sauces—and as a key ingredient in marinades, where it imparts fragrance to proteins such as chicken. During the cooking process, scallion is utilized both in minced form for seasoning and in segmented form, as exemplified by the use of 20g portions when stewing pork ribs. It also functions as an aromatic base when sautéed, contributing depth to broths and hotpot bases. Additionally, scallion is processed into scallion oil, further extending its utility as a flavoring agent. Across these diverse applications, scallion consistently enhances dishes through its distinctive aroma and taste.",

    "return": "Salt is a fundamental and versatile seasoning ingredient widely used in hotpot cuisine and related dishes to enhance and balance flavors. It plays a central role in seasoning both the hotpot broth and individual components such as meats, fish, and sauces. Specifically, salt is added in carefully measured amounts—often described as “appropriate” or “适量” (moderate quantity)—to marinate proteins like spiny catfish and chicken, as well as to season meat mixtures. In broth preparation, salt is typically introduced about two hours into a three-hour simmering process to achieve optimal savory depth, contributing to a well-rounded flavor profile in various soup bases, including fish-based broths and the Spicy Pork Rib and Radish Hotpot. Additionally, in dishes such as Bai Cai Fen Si Guo, salt serves as a basic yet essential seasoning to fine-tune the overall taste according to culinary or personal preference.

    "return": "Boiling is a fundamental cooking method characterized by the immersion and simmering of ingredients in a hot liquid, typically water or broth, until cooked through. In the context of various dishes, boiling serves as the primary technique for preparing multiple hotpot-style meals and soups. Specifically, it is the main method used to prepare the Lamb and Taro Hot Pot, the Spicy Sour Dumpling Hotpot—where ingredients are simmered in a flavorful broth—and the Fish Head Vegetable Hotpot. Boiling is also employed in making Bai Cai Fen Si Guo and general hotpot preparations, including the cooking of meatballs within the broth. Additionally, Maruko Noodle Soup relies on boiling, with its components simmered in water to develop flavor and achieve desired texture. Across these applications, boiling consistently functions as the central culinary process that defines the preparation and character of these liquid-based dishes.",

Analysts attribute the selloff to investor concerns over rising interest rates and regulatory uncertainty.\n\nAmong the hardest hit, nexon technologies saw its stock plummet by 7.8% after reporting lower-than-expected quarterly earnings. In contrast, Omega Energy posted a modest 2.1% gain, driven by rising oil prices.\n\nMeanwhile, commodity markets reflected a mixed sentiment. Gold futures rose by 1.5%, reaching $2,080 per ounce, as investors sought safe-haven assets. Crude oil prices continued their rally, climbing to $87.60 per barrel, supported by supply constraints and strong demand.\n\nFinancial experts are closely watching the Federal Reserve's next move, as speculation grows over potential rate hikes.

They paused beside Jordan and, for a moment, observed the device with something akin to reverence. \"If this tech can be understood...\" Taylor said, their voice quieter, \"It could change the game for us.

Analysts attribute the selloff to investor concerns over rising interest rates and regulatory uncertainty.\n\nAmong the hardest hit, nexon technologies saw its stock plummet by 7.8% after reporting lower-than-expected quarterly earnings. In contrast, Omega Energy posted a modest 2.1% gain, driven by rising oil prices.\n\nMeanwhile, commodity markets reflected a mixed sentiment. Gold futures rose by 1.5%, reaching $2,080 per ounce, as investors sought safe-haven assets. Crude oil prices continued their rally, climbing to $87.60 per barrel, supported by supply constraints and strong demand.\n\nFinancial experts are closely watching the Federal Reserve's next move, as speculation grows over potential rate hikes.

Analysts attribute the selloff to investor concerns over rising interest rates and regulatory uncertainty.\n\nAmong the hardest hit, nexon technologies saw its stock plummet by 7.8% after reporting lower-than-expected quarterly earnings. In contrast, Omega Energy posted a modest 2.1% gain, driven by rising oil prices.\n\nMeanwhile, commodity markets reflected a mixed sentiment. Gold futures rose by 1.5%, reaching $2,080 per ounce, as investors sought safe-haven assets. Crude oil prices continued their rally, climbing to $87.60 per barrel, supported by supply constraints and strong demand.\n\nFinancial experts are closely watching the Federal Reserve's next move, as speculation grows over potential rate hikes. The upcoming policy announcement is expected to influence investor confidence and overall market stability.\n```\n\n<Output>\nentity<|#|>Global Tech Index<|#|>category<|#|>The Global Tech Index tracks

    "return": "Hotpot is a category of dish and a communal dining style originating from Chinese culinary traditions, characterized by a simmering pot of seasoned broth placed at the table or stove, into which diners cook a variety of ingredients such as meats, vegetables, noodles, and other items during the meal. This interactive and shared method of cooking emphasizes collective participation, as each person selects and prepares their preferred ingredients directly in the central pot. The broth base varies widely by region and recipe, ranging from fish-based broths to specialized preparations like Ejiao Red Date Black Chicken Soup, underscoring hotpot’s adaptability and regional diversity.\n\nSpecific dishes such as Bai Cai Fen Si Guo, Fish Head Vegetable Hotpot, Fresh Soup Hotpot, Milk Sweet Corn Hotpot, and Mild Radish Pork Rib Hotpot all fall under the hotpot category, illustrating its broad scope and culinary flexibility. Additionally, Maruko Noodle Soup is also classified as a type of hotpot, further demonstrating the category’s inclusive nature across different ingredient combinations and flavor profiles. Regardless of the specific variation, hotpot consistently features the core elements of tableside or stovetop communal cooking, a shared pot of flavorful broth, and an interactive dining experience that blends social engagement with culinary enjoyment.",
