Analysts attribute the selloff to investor concerns over rising interest rates and regulatory uncertainty.\n\nAmong the hardest hit, nexon technologies saw its stock plummet by 7.8% after reporting lower-than-expected quarterly earnings. In contrast, Omega Energy posted a modest 2.1% gain, driven by rising oil prices.\n\nMeanwhile, commodity markets reflected a mixed sentiment. Gold futures rose by 1.5%, reaching $2,080 per ounce, as investors sought safe-haven assets. Crude oil prices continued their rally, climbing to $87.60 per barrel, supported by supply constraints and strong demand.\n\nFinancial experts are closely watching the Federal Reserve's next move, as speculation grows over potential rate hikes.

Analysts attribute the selloff to investor concerns over rising interest rates and regulatory uncertainty.\n\nAmong the hardest hit, nexon technologies saw its stock plummet by 7.8% after reporting lower-than-expected quarterly earnings. In contrast, Omega Energy posted a modest 2.1% gain, driven by rising oil prices.\n\nMeanwhile, commodity markets reflected a mixed sentiment.

Analysts attribute the selloff to investor concerns over rising interest rates and regulatory uncertainty.\n\nAmong the hardest hit, nexon technologies saw its stock plummet by 7.8% after reporting lower-than-expected quarterly earnings. In contrast, Omega Energy posted a modest 2.1% gain, driven by rising oil prices.\n\nMeanwhile, commodity markets reflected a mixed sentiment. Gold futures rose by 1.5%, reaching $2,080 per ounce, as investors sought safe-haven assets. Crude oil prices continued their rally, climbing to $87.60 per barrel, supported by supply constraints and strong demand.\n\nFinancial experts are closely watching the Federal Reserve's next move, as speculation grows over potential rate hikes.

Analysts attribute the selloff to investor concerns over rising interest rates and regulatory uncertainty.\n\nAmong the hardest hit, nexon technologies saw its stock plummet by 7.8% after reporting lower-than-expected quarterly earnings. In contrast, Omega Energy posted a modest 2.1% gain, driven by rising oil prices.\n\nMeanwhile, commodity markets reflected a mixed sentiment. Gold futures rose by 1.5%, reaching $2,080 per ounce, as investors sought safe-haven assets. Crude oil prices continued their rally, climbing to $87.60 per barrel, supported by supply constraints and strong demand.\n\nFinancial experts are closely watching the Federal Reserve's next move, as speculation grows over potential rate hikes.

In contrast, Omega Energy posted a modest 2.1% gain, driven by rising oil prices.\n\nMeanwhile, commodity markets reflected a mixed sentiment.

Crude oil prices continued their rally, climbing to $87.60 per barrel, supported by supply constraints and strong demand.\n\nFinancial experts are closely watching the Federal Reserve's next move, as speculation grows over potential rate hikes.

Analysts attribute the selloff to investor concerns over rising interest rates and regulatory uncertainty.\n\nAmong the hardest hit, nexon technologies saw its stock plummet by 7.8% after reporting lower-than-expected quarterly earnings. In contrast, Omega Energy posted a modest 2.1% gain, driven by rising oil prices.\n\nMeanwhile, commodity markets reflected a mixed sentiment. Gold futures rose by 1.5%, reaching $2,080 per ounce, as investors sought safe-haven assets. Crude oil prices continued their rally, climbing to $87.60 per barrel, supported by supply constraints and strong demand.\n\nFinancial experts are closely watching the Federal Reserve's next move, as speculation grows over potential rate hikes. The upcoming policy announcement is expected to influence investor confidence and overall market stability.\n```\n\n<Output>\nentity<|#|>Global Tech Index<|#|>category<|#|>The Global Tech Index tracks

In contrast, Omega Energy posted a modest 2.1% gain, driven by rising oil prices.\n\nMeanwhile, commodity markets reflected a mixed sentiment.

Crude oil prices continued their rally, climbing to $87.60 per barrel, supported by supply constraints and strong demand.\n\nFinancial experts are closely watching the Federal Reserve's next move, as speculation grows over potential rate hikes.

In contrast, Omega Energy posted a modest 2.1% gain, driven by rising oil prices.\n\nMeanwhile, commodity markets reflected a mixed sentiment. Gold futures rose by 1.5%, reaching $2,080 per ounce, as investors sought safe-haven assets. Crude oil prices continued their rally, climbing to $87.60 per barrel, supported by supply constraints and strong demand.\n\nFinancial experts are closely watching the Federal Reserve's next move, as speculation grows over potential rate hikes.

Analysts attribute the selloff to investor concerns over rising interest rates and regulatory uncertainty.\n\nAmong the hardest hit, nexon technologies saw its stock plummet by 7.8% after reporting lower-than-expected quarterly earnings. In contrast, Omega Energy posted a modest 2.1% gain, driven by rising oil prices.\n\nMeanwhile, commodity markets reflected a mixed sentiment. Gold futures rose by 1.5%, reaching $2,080 per ounce, as investors sought safe-haven assets. Crude oil prices continued their rally, climbing to $87.60 per barrel, supported by supply constraints and strong demand.\n\nFinancial experts are closely watching the Federal Reserve's next move, as speculation grows over potential rate hikes.

Analysts attribute the selloff to investor concerns over rising interest rates and regulatory uncertainty.\n\nAmong the hardest hit, nexon technologies saw its stock plummet by 7.8% after reporting lower-than-expected quarterly earnings. In contrast, Omega Energy posted a modest 2.1% gain, driven by rising oil prices.\n\nMeanwhile, commodity markets reflected a mixed sentiment.

It is incorporated at multiple stages of cooking: during the initial preparation of the fish or chicken broth, in marinades for proteins such as chicken, and again when reheating the soup for serving. Ginger may be used in various forms—including sliced (typically around 10g when specified), minced, or as part of a ginger-garlic paste—depending on the specific step in the recipe. Its primary culinary contributions are to impart a warm, pungent aroma and to enhance the overall depth of flavor in both the broth and marinated ingredients.

    "return": "Scallion (大葱), a type of green onion, is widely used in culinary applications for its aromatic and flavorful properties. It serves multiple roles across various stages of cooking: as a fresh garnish—particularly in dipping sauces—and as a key ingredient in marinades, where it imparts fragrance to proteins such as chicken. During the cooking process, scallion is utilized both in minced form for seasoning and in segmented form, as exemplified by the use of 20g portions when stewing pork ribs. It also functions as an aromatic base when sautéed, contributing depth to broths and hotpot bases. Additionally, scallion is processed into scallion oil, further extending its utility as a flavoring agent. Across these diverse applications, scallion consistently enhances dishes through its distinctive aroma and taste.",

    "return": "Salt is a fundamental and versatile seasoning ingredient widely used in hotpot cuisine and related dishes to enhance and balance flavors. It plays a central role in seasoning both the hotpot broth and individual components such as meats, fish, and sauces. Specifically, salt is added in carefully measured amounts—often described as “appropriate” or “适量” (moderate quantity)—to marinate proteins like spiny catfish and chicken, as well as to season meat mixtures. In broth preparation, salt is typically introduced about two hours into a three-hour simmering process to achieve optimal savory depth, contributing to a well-rounded flavor profile in various soup bases, including fish-based broths and the Spicy Pork Rib and Radish Hotpot. Additionally, in dishes such as Bai Cai Fen Si Guo, salt serves as a basic yet essential seasoning to fine-tune the overall taste according to culinary or personal preference.

    "return": "Boiling is a fundamental cooking method characterized by the immersion and simmering of ingredients in a hot liquid, typically water or broth, until cooked through. In the context of various dishes, boiling serves as the primary technique for preparing multiple hotpot-style meals and soups. Specifically, it is the main method used to prepare the Lamb and Taro Hot Pot, the Spicy Sour Dumpling Hotpot—where ingredients are simmered in a flavorful broth—and the Fish Head Vegetable Hotpot. Boiling is also employed in making Bai Cai Fen Si Guo and general hotpot preparations, including the cooking of meatballs within the broth. Additionally, Maruko Noodle Soup relies on boiling, with its components simmered in water to develop flavor and achieve desired texture. Across these applications, boiling consistently functions as the central culinary process that defines the preparation and character of these liquid-based dishes.",

Analysts attribute the selloff to investor concerns over rising interest rates and regulatory uncertainty.\n\nAmong the hardest hit, nexon technologies saw its stock plummet by 7.8% after reporting lower-than-expected quarterly earnings. In contrast, Omega Energy posted a modest 2.1% gain, driven by rising oil prices.\n\nMeanwhile, commodity markets reflected a mixed sentiment. Gold futures rose by 1.5%, reaching $2,080 per ounce, as investors sought safe-haven assets. Crude oil prices continued their rally, climbing to $87.60 per barrel, supported by supply constraints and strong demand.\n\nFinancial experts are closely watching the Federal Reserve's next move, as speculation grows over potential rate hikes.

They paused beside Jordan and, for a moment, observed the device with something akin to reverence. \"If this tech can be understood...\" Taylor said, their voice quieter, \"It could change the game for us.

Analysts attribute the selloff to investor concerns over rising interest rates and regulatory uncertainty.\n\nAmong the hardest hit, nexon technologies saw its stock plummet by 7.8% after reporting lower-than-expected quarterly earnings. In contrast, Omega Energy posted a modest 2.1% gain, driven by rising oil prices.\n\nMeanwhile, commodity markets reflected a mixed sentiment. Gold futures rose by 1.5%, reaching $2,080 per ounce, as investors sought safe-haven assets. Crude oil prices continued their rally, climbing to $87.60 per barrel, supported by supply constraints and strong demand.\n\nFinancial experts are closely watching the Federal Reserve's next move, as speculation grows over potential rate hikes.

Analysts attribute the selloff to investor concerns over rising interest rates and regulatory uncertainty.\n\nAmong the hardest hit, nexon technologies saw its stock plummet by 7.8% after reporting lower-than-expected quarterly earnings. In contrast, Omega Energy posted a modest 2.1% gain, driven by rising oil prices.\n\nMeanwhile, commodity markets reflected a mixed sentiment. Gold futures rose by 1.5%, reaching $2,080 per ounce, as investors sought safe-haven assets. Crude oil prices continued their rally, climbing to $87.60 per barrel, supported by supply constraints and strong demand.\n\nFinancial experts are closely watching the Federal Reserve's next move, as speculation grows over potential rate hikes. The upcoming policy announcement is expected to influence investor confidence and overall market stability.\n```\n\n<Output>\nentity<|#|>Global Tech Index<|#|>category<|#|>The Global Tech Index tracks

    "return": "Hotpot is a category of dish and a communal dining style originating from Chinese culinary traditions, characterized by a simmering pot of seasoned broth placed at the table or stove, into which diners cook a variety of ingredients such as meats, vegetables, noodles, and other items during the meal. This interactive and shared method of cooking emphasizes collective participation, as each person selects and prepares their preferred ingredients directly in the central pot. The broth base varies widely by region and recipe, ranging from fish-based broths to specialized preparations like Ejiao Red Date Black Chicken Soup, underscoring hotpot’s adaptability and regional diversity.\n\nSpecific dishes such as Bai Cai Fen Si Guo, Fish Head Vegetable Hotpot, Fresh Soup Hotpot, Milk Sweet Corn Hotpot, and Mild Radish Pork Rib Hotpot all fall under the hotpot category, illustrating its broad scope and culinary flexibility. Additionally, Maruko Noodle Soup is also classified as a type of hotpot, further demonstrating the category’s inclusive nature across different ingredient combinations and flavor profiles. Regardless of the specific variation, hotpot consistently features the core elements of tableside or stovetop communal cooking, a shared pot of flavorful broth, and an interactive dining experience that blends social engagement with culinary enjoyment.",

Analysts attribute the selloff to investor concerns over rising interest rates and regulatory uncertainty.\n\nAmong the hardest hit, nexon technologies saw its stock plummet by 7.8% after reporting lower-than-expected quarterly earnings. In contrast, Omega Energy posted a modest 2.1% gain, driven by rising oil prices.\n\nMeanwhile, commodity markets reflected a mixed sentiment. Gold futures rose by 1.5%, reaching $2,080 per ounce, as investors sought safe-haven assets. Crude oil prices continued their rally, climbing to $87.60 per barrel, supported by supply constraints and strong demand.\n\nFinancial experts are closely watching the Federal Reserve's next move, as speculation grows over potential rate hikes.

It is commonly employed in multiple forms—fresh, minced, sliced, crushed, or as part of a ginger-garlic paste—depending on the culinary context and desired intensity of flavor. In hotpot cooking, garlic is often sautéed in oil at the beginning of the process to build a rich aromatic base for the broth, contributing significantly to the overall fragrance and taste of the dish. Typically, even a single clove can impart noticeable aroma and flavor, underscoring its potency and essential role in seasoning. Across all preparations, garlic serves a consistent function: to add complexity, savoriness, and a distinctive pungent note that defines many savory culinary traditions.",

    "return": "Salt is a fundamental and versatile seasoning ingredient, consistently described as the “king of flavors,” and is used across a wide range of hotpot and soup-based dishes to enhance, balance, and fine-tune taste. In hotpot cuisine, salt plays a central role in seasoning both the broth and individual components such as meats, fish, and sauces. It is typically added in carefully measured or “appropriate” amounts—often referenced as “适量” (moderate quantity)—to achieve optimal flavor without overpowering other ingredients. For instance, in the preparation of complex broths like the Spicy Pork Rib and Radish Hotpot or fish-based soups, salt is introduced approximately two hours into a three-hour simmering process to develop a well-rounded, savory depth. It is also essential in marinating proteins such as spiny catfish and chicken, as well as in seasoning meat mixtures.\n\nBeyond specific hotpot varieties, salt serves as a basic yet indispensable seasoning in numerous related dishes, including Bai Cai Fen Si Guo, Fresh Soup Hotpot, Mild Radish Pork Rib Hotpot, and Maruko Noodle Soup. In each case, it is used sparingly but strategically to adjust the overall flavor profile according to culinary standards or personal preference. Whether seasoning broth directly “to taste” or acting as a foundational element in soup bases, salt remains a core component for achieving balance and depth in these savory preparations.",

    "return": "Stewing is a versatile and widely used cooking method characterized by simmering ingredients in liquid over low heat for an extended period to develop deep flavors and tenderize components. It serves as the primary technique in preparing a variety of dishes across different culinary traditions. In Chinese cuisine, stewing is employed to create nourishing soups and hotpots, such as Ejiao Red Date Black Chicken Soup and Mild Radish Pork Rib Hotpot, where ingredients like chicken, pork ribs, or fish bones are gently simmered with aromatics to extract rich, savory broths. Similarly, it is used to prepare the hotpot base by simmering chicken with aromatic seasonings, and to cook small intestine in specific recipes, ensuring tenderness and flavor infusion.\n\nThe method is adaptable to different vessels and tools: it can be executed in a traditional clay pot over low heat for about an hour, allowing for slow, even cooking, or expedited using a pressure cooker while still maintaining the core principle of simmering ingredients in liquid. Stewing also features in Korean-inspired preparations, such as Kimchi Mixed Mushroom Braised Chicken, demonstrating its cross-cultural applicability. Whether using poultry, offal, seafood, or vegetables, stewing consistently emphasizes gentle, prolonged cooking in a flavorful liquid medium to achieve cohesive, aromatic, and comforting dishes.",

Analysts attribute the selloff to investor concerns over rising interest rates and regulatory uncertainty.\n\nAmong the hardest hit, nexon technologies saw its stock plummet by 7.8% after reporting lower-than-expected quarterly earnings. In contrast, Omega Energy posted a modest 2.1% gain, driven by rising oil prices.\n\nMeanwhile, commodity markets reflected a mixed sentiment. Gold futures rose by 1.5%, reaching $2,080 per ounce, as investors sought safe-haven assets. Crude oil prices continued their rally, climbing to $87.60 per barrel, supported by supply constraints and strong demand.\n\nFinancial experts are closely watching the Federal Reserve's next move, as speculation grows over potential rate hikes.

In contrast, Omega Energy posted a modest 2.1% gain, driven by rising oil prices.\n\nMeanwhile, commodity markets reflected a mixed sentiment.

Crude oil prices continued their rally, climbing to $87.60 per barrel, supported by supply constraints and strong demand.\n\nFinancial experts are closely watching the Federal Reserve's next move, as speculation grows over potential rate hikes.

Analysts attribute the selloff to investor concerns over rising interest rates and regulatory uncertainty.\n\nAmong the hardest hit, nexon technologies saw its stock plummet by 7.8% after reporting lower-than-expected quarterly earnings. In contrast, Omega Energy posted a modest 2.1% gain, driven by rising oil prices.\n\nMeanwhile, commodity markets reflected a mixed sentiment.

In each of these dishes, boiling serves both to develop the flavor of the broth and to cook the constituent ingredients, such as meatballs, pork ribs, tofu, vegetables, and noodles.\n\nThe method consistently functions as the defining culinary process for these liquid-based meals, with ingredients simmered directly in the broth to achieve desired textures and meld flavors. For example, Maruko Noodle Soup relies on boiling to simultaneously cook its components and infuse them with taste, while pork ribs are boiled both to tenderize the meat and to form the foundational element of certain hotpot assemblies. Overall, boiling is not only a practical cooking technique but also a core element that shapes the character, consistency, and sensory experience of these traditional and regional dishes.",

It plays multiple roles across various stages of cooking, functioning both as a foundational aromatic and as a finishing garnish. In broth and soup base preparation—such as in Fresh Soup Hotpot—scallion is typically cleaned, chopped, or cut into segments and used in moderate or appropriate amounts to build depth and aroma. It is commonly stir-fried alongside other aromatics like ginger, garlic, and dried chili to form a flavor base for dishes.\n\nBeyond its role in foundational cooking, scallion is frequently added toward the end of preparation as a fresh garnish, enhancing both the visual appeal and aromatic profile of finished dishes. It is also a key component in dipping sauces, where its fresh, pungent notes complement other ingredients. Additionally, scallion is incorporated into marinades to infuse proteins like chicken with fragrance, and it appears in specific measured forms—such as 20g segmented portions—when stewing meats like pork ribs. Its utility extends further through processing into scallion oil, a concentrated flavoring agent. Across all these applications, scallion consistently contributes its characteristic aroma and taste, underscoring its importance in diverse culinary contexts.",

Crude oil prices continued their rally, climbing to $87.60 per barrel, supported by supply constraints and strong demand.\n\nFinancial experts are closely watching the Federal Reserve's next move, as speculation grows over potential rate hikes.

When minced, it is often sautéed with garlic to form a foundational flavor base. It also appears as a garnish in some preparations.

It was this competitive undercurrent that kept him alert, the sense that his and Jordan's shared commitment to discovery was an unspoken rebellion against Cruz's narrowing vision of control and order.\n\nThen Taylor did something unexpected. They paused beside Jordan and, for a moment, observed the device with something akin to reverence. \"If this tech can be understood...\" Taylor said, their voice quieter, \"It could change the game for us.

In contrast, Omega Energy posted a modest 2.1% gain, driven by rising oil prices.\n\nMeanwhile, commodity markets reflected a mixed sentiment.

Crude oil prices continued their rally, climbing to $87.60 per barrel, supported by supply constraints and strong demand.\n\nFinancial experts are closely watching the Federal Reserve's next move, as speculation grows over potential rate hikes.

Capitalize the first letter of each significant word (title case) if the name is case-insensitive.\n        *   `target_entity`: The name of the target entity. Ensure **consistent naming** with entity extraction. Capitalize the first letter of each significant word (title case) if the name is case-insensitive.\n        *   `relationship_keywords`: One or more high-level keywords summarizing the overarching nature, concepts, or themes of the relationship. Multiple keywords within this field must be separated by a comma `,`. **DO NOT use `<|#|>` for separating multiple keywords within this field.**\n        *   `relationship_description`: A concise explanation of the nature of the relationship between the source and target entities, providing a clear rationale for their connection.\n    *   **Output Format - Relationships:** Output a total of 5 fields for each relationship, delimited by `<|#|>`, on a single line. The first field *must* be the literal string `relation`.\n        *   Format: `relation<|#|>source_entity<|#|>target_entity<|#|>relationship_keywords<|#|>relationship_description`\n\n3.  **Delimiter Usage Protocol:**\n    *   The `<|#|>` is a complete, atomic marker and **must not be filled with content**. It serves strictly as a field separator.\n    *   **Incorrect Example:** `entity<|#|>Tokyo<|location|>Tokyo is the capital of Japan.`\n    *   **Correct Example:** `entity<|#|>Tokyo<|#|>location<|#|>Tokyo is the capital of Japan.`\n\n4.  **Relationship Direction & Duplication:**\n    *   Treat all relationships as **undirected** unless explicitly stated otherwise. Swapping the source and target entities for an undirected relationship does not constitute a new relationship.\n    *   Avoid outputting duplicate relationships.\n\n5.  **Output Order & Prioritization:**\n    *   Output all extracted entities first, followed by all extracted relationships.\n    *   Within the list of relationships, prioritize and output those relationships that are **most significant** to the core meaning of the input text first.\n\n6.  **Context & Objectivity:**\n    *   Ensure all entity names and descriptions are written in the **third person**.\n    *   Explicitly name the subject or object; **avoid using pronouns** such as `this article`, `this paper`, `our company`, `I`, `you`, and `he/she`.\n\n7.  **Language & Proper Nouns:**\n    *   The entire output (entity names, keywords, and descriptions) must be written in `English`.\n    *   Proper nouns (e.g., personal names, place names, organization names) should be retained in their original language if a proper, widely accepted translation is not available or would cause ambiguity.\n\n8.  **Completion Signal:** Output the literal string `<|COMPLETE|>` only after all entities and relationships, following all criteria, have been completely extracted and outputted.\n\n---Examples---\n<Input Text>\n```\nwhile Alex clenched his jaw, the buzz of frustration dull against the backdrop of Taylor's authoritarian certainty.

Analysts attribute the selloff to investor concerns over rising interest rates and regulatory uncertainty.\n\nAmong the hardest hit, nexon technologies saw its stock plummet by 7.8% after reporting lower-than-expected quarterly earnings. In contrast, Omega Energy posted a modest 2.1% gain, driven by rising oil prices.\n\nMeanwhile, commodity markets reflected a mixed sentiment. Gold futures rose by 1.5%, reaching $2,080 per ounce, as investors sought safe-haven assets. Crude oil prices continued their rally, climbing to $87.60 per barrel, supported by supply constraints and strong demand.\n\nFinancial experts are closely watching the Federal Reserve's next move, as speculation grows over potential rate hikes.

一大块\n\n**做法**:\n1:三黄鸡去毛，洗净，斩块，焯水后备用。2:鲢鱼去鳞、去腮、去内脏、去腹内黑膜，洗净切两公分大小的块。鱼太大的话，可以将鱼头剁下，另作他用（可做剁椒鱼头或鱼头汤等3:泡姜切丝，泡辣椒切碎4:葱切段。5:大蒜拍散去皮备用。6:锅里放入适量花生油，烧热后加入花椒爆锅，然后放入泡姜泡辣椒煸炒至水汽干。7:放入适量红油剁椒酱或红油豆瓣，翻炒均匀至吐红油。红油剁椒酱是我将红色泡椒用料理机搅碎后，用植物油慢慢炸制而成，色泽红亮，香气十足。红油豆瓣，我也是自己做的，一年做一次，做一次要吃一两年。如果这两样您家都没有，那么，就上超市去买一包郫县豆瓣，也是可以的。8:加入焯过水的鸡肉反复翻炒至水汽干，再倒入一勺酱油，继续翻炒至出红油。9:加入适量清水或骨头汤，有高汤也行。倒入少许料酒或白酒。10:放入咖喱膏。根据汤的咸淡适当调味。11:汤开后，转中火，将鸡肉煮至肉刚软好咀嚼时，将鸡肉和汤倒入大小合适的平底煮锅，再倒入鱼块和拍好的大蒜，并用锅铲将鱼块往汤里压一压，确保能被汤淹着。注：因鱼肉不可随便翻动，所以建议换成平底煮锅，煮好后连肉带锅一起端上桌，就可保证鱼肉的完整。12:烧开后，视咸淡调入盐，将鱼块煮过心，再加入少许鸡精、味精，然后放上葱段。用锅铲将葱段稍微压一压，将其稍微烫一下，烫断生，泡椒鸡焖鱼就做好了。13:成品。\n```\n[{\"role\":

    "return": "Cooking Wine is a culinary ingredient primarily used in Chinese and other East Asian cuisines to deodorize and enhance the flavor of various dishes. It is commonly employed to remove undesirable odors—referred to as “腥味” (xīng wèi), which encompasses fishy, gamey, or meaty smells—from proteins such as fish, chicken, lamb, and pork. Specifically, Cooking Wine is used to marinate fish slices and spiny catfish, deodorize fish heads during preparation, and blanch chicken to eliminate gamey notes. It is also added to pork mince to reduce meaty odors and enrich aroma. In broth-based preparations, Cooking Wine contributes both to odor removal and depth of flavor. During lamb stewing, it is used initially in boiling and then again in a larger quantity—about two tablespoons—to intensify the dish’s overall taste. Common types of Cooking Wine include rice wine and baijiu, which are incorporated into braising liquids and marinades for their dual function of deodorizing and flavor enhancement. In some recipes, it is referred to as “liao,” highlighting its role as a fundamental seasoning agent.",
